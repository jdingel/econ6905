## ECON G6905: Topics in Trade

Jonathan Dingel\
Columbia University\
Spring 2025

This graduate course covers topics in economic geography and regional economics.
We will extensively cover the methods use to estimate, calibrate, simulate, and solve quantitative models in trade, spatial, and urban economics.
The methods topics covered will include estimating gravity regressions with high-dimensional fixed effects, computing counterfactual outcomes by exact hat algebra, choosing and implementing numerical solution methods, and conducting Monte Carlo simulations.

This class is part of the trade and spatial second-year PhD sequence.
It complements the classes taught by David Weinstein and Donald Davis.
I will introduce concepts and models in a self-contained fashion, but I will assume that second-year students are familiar with the material taught in already-completed classes in the sequence.

### Logistics

Class schedule: Wednesdays 8:10 AM - 10:00 AM\
Email: <jid2106@columbia.edu>\
Office: IAB 1126B\
Office hours: By appointment, please email

### Assessment

Grades will be based on assignments (75%) and a final exam (25%).

Assignments will be posted to the GitHub repository.
Submit your work via the Courseworks site.

Assignments will come in various forms:
- Economics: We will ask you to derive a theoretical result or survey an empirical literature.
- Programming: We will ask you to write a function that solves for equilibrium or estimates a parameter. See comments on computation below.
- Writing: I will ask to rewrite the abstract of a recent paper.

In addition to course material, the final exam may ask you to propose an original research idea, so you should be thinking about these during our class (and for the rest of your life!).

### Computation

Scientific computation is important.
I hope that you have already been exposed to the basics.
Please glance at Jesus Fernandez-Villaverde's "[Computational Methods for Economists](https://www.sas.upenn.edu/~jesusfv/teaching.html)" course.
My workflow is outlined in my [project template](https://github.com/jdingel/projecttemplate).

You have choices to make.
See "[A Comparison of Programming Languages in
Economics](https://github.com/jesusfv/Comparison-Programming-Languages-Economics)."
[I recommend](https://tradediversion.net/2018/09/17/why-i-encourage-econ-phd-students-to-learn-julia/)
the [Julia language](http://www.julialang.org).
Julia's advantages are that it is open source and typically faster than Matlab.
To get started doing economics in Julia, see Perla, Sargent, and Stachurski's
"[Lectures in Quantitative Economics](https://lectures.quantecon.org/jl/)."
You may submit Julia or Matlab code as homework solutions.
Please confer with me before submitting code written in other languages.

Standards for transparency and replicability are rising quickly.
The AEA has appointed a [Data Editor](https://github.com/AEADataEditor/) who will verify that code works [prior](https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/policies/data-code) to accepting papers for publication.
Please write code for this class that is transparent and self-contained.
