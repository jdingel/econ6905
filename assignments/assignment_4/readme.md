ECON G6905: Topics in Trade\
Fall 2025\
Assignment 4\
Due: Start of final exam

This assignment has two components: a referee report and rewriting a published abstract.

## Referee report

Write a referee report (2-3 pages) on one of the papers presented in the Trade and Spatial Workshop this semester.

Your report should summarize the working paper's primary contribution in one paragraph.
Proceed to offer criticisms and suggestions.
Make three or four main points, devoting a paragraph to each, that constitute advice for the authors (and insight for the editor).
Conclude the report with a list of smaller comments.
It's fine to be critical, but also offer realistic suggestions for improvement.

You may find it interesting to read Berk, Harvey, and Hirshleifer's "[Preparing a Referee Report: Guidelines and Perspectives](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2547191)",
although many of the issues discussed therein are not crucial to writing a report solely for class purposes.

## Rewriting an abstract

Select an article from the *Journal of International Economics* published in 2021-2024.
Rewrite the abstract, limiting yourself to 100 words, as discussed in class.
