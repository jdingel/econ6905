ECON G6905: Topics in Trade\
Spring 2025\
Assignment 4\
Due: Start of final exam

This assignment has two components: a referee report and rewriting a published abstract.

## Referee report

Write a referee report (2-3 pages) on one of the following recent job market papers:
- Benny Kleinman - [Wage Inequality and the Spatial Expansion of Firms](https://www.bennykleinman.com/)
- Constanza Abuin - [Power Decarbonization in a Global Energy Market: The Climate Effect of U.S. LNG Exports](https://sites.harvard.edu/constanza-abuin/job-market-paper/)
- Daniel Velasquez - [Highways, Commuting and Trade: Unpacking Suburban Growth](https://dvelasquezc.github.io/research/JMP.html)
- Hugo Lhuillier - [Should I Stay or Should I Grow? How Cities Affect Learning, Inequality and Productivity](https://www.hugolhuillier.com/research)
- Olivia Bordeu - [Commuting Infrastructure in Fragmented Cities](https://www.oliviabordeu.com/)
- Prakash Mishra - [The Global Allocative Efficiency of Deforestation](https://dvelasquezc.github.io/research/JMP.html)


Your report should summarize the working paper's primary contribution in one paragraph.
Proceed to offer criticisms and suggestions.
Make three or four main points, devoting a paragraph to each, that constitute advice for the authors (and insight for the editor).
Conclude the report with a list of smaller comments.
It's fine to be critical, but also offer realistic suggestions for improvement.

You may find it interesting to read Berk, Harvey, and Hirshleifer's "[Preparing a Referee Report: Guidelines and Perspectives](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2547191)",
although many of the issues discussed therein are not crucial to writing a report solely for class purposes.

## Rewriting an abstract

Select an article from the *Journal of International Economics* published in 2021-2024.
Rewrite the abstract, limiting yourself to 100 words, as discussed in class.
