Assignment 2\
Due: Beginning of week 5 class

This assignment looks at the estimation of "gravity" regressions for commuting flows between Detroit neighborhoods.

### Deliverables

For this assignment, please produce the following six outputs that are described in detail below:

1.  A table reporting a log-linear gravity regression.
    The table should have four columns, each employing a different Stata estimator to estimate the same specification:`reg`, `xtreg`,`areg`, `reghdfe`.
    The table should have two panels (distance vs time).
    Report the computation time associated with each regression.
2.  A table with eight columns reporting the results of regressing commuting flows on the same covariate when including observations for which commuting flows are zero.
    Use the Stata estimators specified below.
3.  A table reporting computation times in a race between `reghdfe`, `FixedEffectModels.jl`, and `fixest` for the non-zero commuting flows.
4.  A table reporting computation times in a race between `ppmlhdfe`, `GLFixedEffectModels.jl`, and `fixest` for PPML estimation with high-dimensional fixed effects.
5.  A PDF that contains the tables listed above and responses to the questions about them that appear below.
6.  Code that produces all of the above.

Submit all your code, the TeX output, and the compiled PDFs in one ZIP file via Courseworks before the deadline.\
You may consult your classmates while working on the assignment, but each individual student must submit their own (distinct) code and output.

Please allow me to run your code on my machine by minimizing
your use of machine-specific filepaths.
Define a global variable for the filepath at the top of your scripts or, preferably, write everything using [relative filepaths](https://help.github.com/articles/about-readmes/#relative-links-and-image-paths-in-readme-files).
Your R and Julia scripts should load all required packages (and your Stata script should list what packages are assumed).
(In real replication packages, you need to provide [package installation tools](https://twitter.com/AeaData/status/1250118911313534979)).

### Instructions

#### Download data

The `data` folder for this assignment contains a 19 MB ZIP file.
`Detroit.csv` contains commuting flows between Detroit census tracts in 2014.
- The keys that define a row are two Census tracts: `home_ID` and `work_ID`
- `flows` is the integer-valued number of people who reside in `home_ID` and work in `work_ID`
- `distance_straight_miles` is the straight-line distance between the two tracts
- `distance_Google_miles` is the driving distance reported by Google Maps
- `duration_minutes` is the driving time reported by Google Maps


#### Stata estimation

The `reg`, `xtreg`, `areg`, and `glm` packages are included in Stata by default.
Install the `reghdfe`, `ppml`, `poi2hdfe`, and `ppmlhdfe` on your machine using the `ssc install` command.
Use the `timer` function in Stata.

Warning:
I find that `outreg2` can be quite slow if you have many fixed effects.
I suggest using the `estout` package to produce TeX tables for this assignment.

##### Table 1: Log-linear estimation

Estimate a regression of log (non-zero) commuters on log bilateral (Google driving) distance, origin fixed effects, and destination fixed effects.
When using `reg`, you will have to create the fixed-effect dummies.
When using the `xtreg`, `areg`, and `reghdfe` commands, use the fixed-effect options to absorb them.

Your table should have two panels.
In the top panel, use the Google-driving-distance covariate.
In the bottom panel, use the Google-driving-time covariate.

You should find that your coefficient on log distance when using `reg` is -.40716; the standard error should be .00120.

Report the computation time for each of the eight regressions.

Include answers to the following questions about Table 1 in your TeX file:

1.  Are the point estimates and standard errors numerically identical
    across the different estimators? Should they be?
2.  Are the number of observations and R-squared statistics identical?
    Should they be?
3.  Compare the relative computation times of these estimators.
4.  Are the coefficients on the distance and time covariates the same? Should they be?

##### Table 2: Zeros

Now we examine the roles of zeros in the commuting matrix.
Run a regression using the Google-driving-distance covariate.
Use Stata estimators and the following specifications to produce a table
containing 8 columns:

1.  A log-linear regression that omits observations in which flow equals zero.
2.  A log-linear regression that omits observations in which flow equals zero.
	In addition, set the dependent variable to log of flow plus one.
3.  A log-linear regression in which the dependent variable is log of flow plus one.
4.  A log-linear regression in which the dependent variable is log of flow plus 0.01.
5.  A log-linear regression in which the dependent variable is log flow, but flows X<sub>ij</sub> that are zero in the data are replaced by the value log(10<sup>-12</sup> times X<sub>jj</sub>) as the dependent variable.
6.  An estimate of the same constant-elasticity specification that uses [the `poi2hdfe` command](https://ideas.repec.org/c/boc/bocode/s457777.html) to implement the [PPML estimator](http://personal.lse.ac.uk/tenreyro/LGW.html) of Guimaraes, Figueirdo, and Woodward (REStat 2003) and Silva and Tenreyro (REStat 2006). Use all observations, including zeros, in this and the next column.
7.  An estimate of the same constant-elasticity specification that uses [the `ppmlhdfe` command](http://scorreia.com/software/ppmlhdfe/) to implement the PPML estimator.
8.  An estimate of the constant-elasticity specification that uses [the `ppmlhdfe` command](http://scorreia.com/software/ppmlhdfe/) to implement the PPML estimator. Omit observations in which flow equals zero.

Include answers to the following questions about Table 2 in your TeX
file:

1.  Are your results sensitive to the omission of zeros?
2.  How well does transforming the dependent variable to be log(x+1), log(x+0.01), or 10<sup>-12</sup>X<sub>jj</sub> if zero work? Is the result sensitive to the choice of transformation?
3.  Examine the residuals from your log-linear regression. Are they heteroskedastic? Report a Breusch–Pagan test statistic and a scatterplot of the residuals that addresses this question.
4.  How do the computation times compare?

#### Table 3: Comparing Stata’s reghdfe, Julia’s FixedEffectModels, R's fixest

Now estimate the log-linear specification of Table 1 using non-zero commuting flows using `reghdfe` again.
Compare the speed of this calculation to the speed of estimating it in Julia using the `FixedEffectModels` package and in R using the `fixest` package.
Use heteroskedastic-robust standard errors in all cases.

Julia:
<!-- -   Use the [StatFiles package](https://github.com/queryverse/StatFiles.jl) to load a DTA file if need be. -->
-   Use the [FixedEffectModels package](https://github.com/matthieugomez/FixedEffectModels.jl) to estimate.
-   Use the [RegressionTables package](https://github.com/jmboehm/RegressionTables.jl) to produce tables.
-   Use the [`@time` macro](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/performance-tips/index.html) in Julia to track performance.
-   Note that Julia functions are compiled the first time they are run, so the first run will be slow and you should not use the full-size data the first time you call your function.

R:
<!-- - Use the [foreign package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/foreign/index.html) to load the DTA file. -->
- Use the [fixest package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/fixest/index.html) to estimate ([short intro to fixest](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/fixest/vignettes/fixest_walkthrough.html), [fixest at GitHub](https://github.com/lrberge/fixest)).
- You likely know better than me how to export a pretty table from an R regression.

Include answers to the following questions in your submission:

1.  Verify that `reghdfe`, `FixedEffectModels`, and `fixest` return
    identical point estimates. Are the standard errors identical?
2.  Which estimator is faster? By what magnitude?

#### Table 4: Comparing Stata's ppmlhdfe, Julia's GLFixedEffectModels, and R's fepois

Let's compare using the Stata `ppmlhdfe` package to using the Julia [GLFixedEffectModels](https://github.com/jmboehm/GLFixedEffectModels.jl) package and using the `fepois` alias in the R `fixest` package.
Use each of these packages to estimate the constant-elasticity specification by PPML with high-dimensional fixed effects using all observations, as you did in column 7 of Table 2 above.
Report the estimates of this specification from each of the three languages.

Include answers to the following questions in your submission:

1.  Verify that `ppmlhdfe`, `GLFixedEffectModels`, and `fixest` return identical point estimates. Are the standard errors identical?
2.  Which estimator is faster? By what magnitude?
