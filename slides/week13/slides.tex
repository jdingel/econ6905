	\item \href{https://hbr.org/2005/12/regional-strategies-for-global-leadership}{Ford COO}: ``The single biggest barrier to globalization [in autos]\dots is the relatively cheap cost of motor fuel in the US\dots creates an accompanying disparity in\dots the most fundamental of vehicle characteristics: size and power.''

	\item Key element: Locational advantages across different stages
	\item If you ignore the boundary of the firm, the same logic that drives specialization for arms-length sourcing transactions would drive specialization within the firm

% -----------------------------------------
\begin{frame}{Tangible and intangible inputs}
\begin{itemize}
\item Standard account of fragmentation emphasizes specialization: upstream unit produces inputs for \href{http://markets.ft.com/research/Lexicon/Term?term=downstream}{downstream} unit
\item {Domestic: Median upstream establishment sends 0.4\% of its shipments to its firm's downstream establishments {\small (\href{http://pubs.aeaweb.org.proxy.uchicago.edu/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/aer.104.4.1120}{Atalay, Hortacsu, Syverson 2014})}\par}

\item Multiplant firms are more likely to own plants in related industries, but that isn't associated with tangible flows of inputs

\begin{itemize}
\item Study the same 47 plant openings as \href{https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/653714}{Greenstone, Hornbeck, Moretti (2010)}
(11 in `82--`85, 18 `86--`89, 18 `90--`93)
(cf. \href{https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ecin.12339}{Patrick 2016})
\item Million-dollar plant (``MDP'') openings raise productivity of local plants and distant plants that belong to multi-plant firms with a local establishment
\item This ``global'' productivity spillover does not decay with distance and is stronger if plants are in industries that share knowledge with each other
\item While productivity spillovers between plants of \textit{different} firms are highly localized, they seem to propagate without much friction between different plants of the \textit{same} firm

\item Plant-level productivity depends on local knowledge and knowledge in other regions in which the parent firm operates
\item Within a region and sector, plants' productivities aggregate into a single productivity index
\item Across regions and sectors, model nests an economic-geography version of Caliendo and Parro (2015)
\item Estimate model parameters by matching diff-in-diffs coefficients for plant-level micro moments
\item Counterfactual scenario: ``the aggregate gains are greatest if the plant opens in a well-developed region, consistent with the observed location choices of the MDPs in the data''
