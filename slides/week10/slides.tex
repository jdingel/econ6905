Economic geography of human capital:
Where do skilled workers live and why?

My goal today is to tackle four questions:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Why should we care about the spatial distributions of skills and sectors?
	\item How do we know that agglomeration is skill-biased?
	\item How should we characterize skills when modeling cities?
	\item What tools are relevant for building and estimating models?

Why should we care about the spatial distributions of skills and sectors?

	\item They covary with city characteristics

\begin{frame}{They are often used as exogenous variation}
It is common to see the following theory-empirics pairing:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Model: all locations produce a homogeneous good
	\item Estimation by shift-share design: exogenous shifts in local labor demand via local industrial composition $\times$ national changes in industrial employment
\end{itemize}
What variation does this shift-share design exploit?
\begin{itemize}
	\item \href{https://paulgp.github.io/papers/bartik_gpss.pdf}{GPSS}: employment shares are IVs measuring exposure to shifts
	\item \href{https://doi.org/10.1093/qje/qjz025}{AKM} \& \href{https://doi.org/10.1093/restud/rdab030}{BHJ}: sectoral shifters are randomly assigned and independent
	\item Skill mix vs industry mix (e.g., endogenous local SBTC of \href{http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/658371}{Beaudry, Doms, Lewis 2010})

% -----------------------------------------
\begin{frame}{Spatial equilibrium with two skill groups}
A simple starting point
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Two skill groups, $s \in \{L,H\}$
	\item Elastic labor supply: $U_s(A_c,w_{s,c},p_{c}) = U_s(A_{c'},w_{s,c'},p_{c'}) \ \forall c,c' \ \forall s$
	\item Homothetic preferences: $U_s(A_{c},w_{s,c},p_{c}) = \frac{w_{s,c} A_{c}}{p_{c}}$
\end{enumerate}
\medskip \pause 
These jointly imply that relative wages are spatially invariant:
\begin{align*}
\frac{w_{H,c} A_{c}}{ p_{c}} = \frac{w_{H,c'}A_{c'}}{p_{c'}} 
\quad&\textnormal{ and }\quad 
\frac{w_{L,c} A_{c}}{p_{c}} = \frac{w_{L,c'}A_{c'} }{p_{c'}} \\
\implies \frac{w_{H,c}}{w_{L,c}} &= \frac{w_{H,c'}}{w_{L,c'}} \ \forall c,c'

Preferences are not homothetic.

Relative prices of income-elastic goods are lower in larger cities:
\begin{itemize}
\item Income elasticity of housing demand is less than one:\\
\href{https://www.nber.org/papers/w22816}{Albouy, Ehrlich, and Liu (2016)}, \href{https://trevorcwilliams.github.io/files/submission_fw.pdf}{Finlay and Williams (2023)}

\href{https://doi.org/10.1093/restud/rdw054}{Dingel (2017)}, \href{https://doi.org/10.3982/ECTA11738}{Handbury (2021)}, \href{https://www.tksonoda.com/}{Onoda (2023)}

% -----------------------------------------
\begin{frame}{What is skill-biased agglomeration?}
The canonical model is one way of interpreting the central fact
\begin{itemize}
	\item In two-type model,
larger cities have higher relative demand for skill
\item With more than two underlying types,
these relative quantities and relative prices may reflect compositional differences (i.e., spatial sorting)
\item I read the available empirical evidence as saying two types are not enough
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
% -----------------------------------------
\begin{frame}{Two types in theory and practice}
Two-type models can be simple -- but what about two-type empirics?
\begin{itemize}
	\item Omit types: Davis \& Dingel (2019) plot of college wage premia shows bachelor's vs HS diplomas -- use only 45\% of population to test price prediction
	\item Convert quantities to ``equivalents'': ``one person with some college is equivalent to a total of 0.69 of a high school graduate and 0.29 of a college graduate'' (\href{http://www.jstor.org/stable/2118323}{Katz \& Murphy 1992}, p.68)
\end{itemize}
\pause Results may be sensitive to dichotomous definitions
\begin{itemize}
	%\item Berry \& Glaeser (2005): ``US metropolitan areas with more college graduates in 1990 became increasingly skilled over the 1990s''
	\item \href{https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20131706}{Diamond (2016)}: ``A MSA's share of college graduates in 1980 is positively associated with larger growth in its share of college workers from 1980 to 2000''
	\item \href{https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/app.20160510}{Baum-Snow, Freedman, Pavan (2015)}: ``Diamond's result does not hold for CBSAs if those with some college education are included in the skilled group.''

% -----------------------------------------
\begin{frame}{Dichotomous approach misses relevant variation}
\begin{itemize}
	\item In labor economics, the canonical two-skill model ``is largely silent on a number of central empirical developments of the last three decades'', such as wage polarization and job polarization (\href{http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169721811024105}{Acemoglu and Autor 2011})
	\item In the urban context, there is systematic variation across cities in terms of finer observable categories: population elasticities for high school graduates (.925), associate's degree (0.997), bachelor's degree (1.087), and professional degree (1.113) (\href{https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinteco.2020.103291}{Davis and Dingel 2020})

\begin{frame}{How much should we worry about spatial sorting?}
Contrasting views.
Suggestions of sorting:
\begin{itemize}
	\item  {\small ``Workers in cities with a well-educated labor force are likely to have unobserved characteristics that make them more productive than workers with the same level of schooling in cities with a less-educated labor force. For example, a lawyer in New York is likely to be different from a lawyer in El Paso, TX.'' (\href{https://ideas.repec.org/h/eee/regchp/4-51.html}{Moretti 2004, p.2246})\par}

	\end{itemize}
Claim of little sorting (e.g., \href{http://diegopuga.org/research/dreams.pdf}{de la Roca, Ottaviano, Puga 2023}) stems from:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Cognitive test scores in NLSY79 (11,000 US individuals)

We have models of: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Knowledge spillovers as a pure externality (one interpretation of Henderson 1974, Black 1999, Lucas 2001)
	\item Endogenous exchange of ideas in a single (or symmetric) location(s) (Helsley and Strange 2004, Berliant, Reed III, and Wang 2006, Berliant and Fujita 2008, Lucas and Moll 2014)
\end{itemize}
Our contribution:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Introduce a model of a system of cities in which costly idea exchange is the agglomeration force 
	\item Our model replicates a broad set of facts about the cross section of cities
	\item We provide a spatial-equilibrium explanation of why skill premia are higher in larger cities and how this emerges from symmetric fundamentals

% -----------------------------------------
\begin{frame}{Model summary}
Our model's core components: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Spatial equilibrium -- zero mobility costs 
\item Heterogeneous workers -- continuum of abilities 
\item Two sectors: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Tradables: Labor heterogeneity matters for productivity
	\item Non-tradables: Homogeneous productivity
\end{itemize}
\item Skilled tradables sector has local learning opportunities 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Workers choose to spend time exchanging ideas 
	\item Gains from interactions increasing in own ability and peers' ability
\end{itemize}
\item Congestion costs make housing more expensive in larger cities 
\item Workers choose locations, occupations, and time spent exchanging ideas 
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
% -----------------------------------------
\begin{frame}{Preferences and congestion}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Preferences: Unit demand for housing and $\bar{n}$-unit demand for non-tradable:
	\begin{equation*}
	V(p_{n,c},p_{h,c},y)= y-p_{n,c}\bar{n}-p_{h,c}. \label{indirect_utility}
	\end{equation*}
	\item Each individual in a city of population $L_c$ pays a net urban cost (in units of the numeraire) of 
	\begin{equation*}
	p_{h,c} = \theta L_c^\gamma
	\end{equation*}
	\item Individuals are perfectly mobile across cities and jobs, so their locational and occupational choices maximize $V(p_{n,c},p_{h,c},y)$.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
% -----------------------------------------
\begin{frame}{Production}
\begin{itemize}
	\item An individual can produce tradables ($t$) or non-tradables ($n$)
	\item An individual working in sector $\sigma$ earns income equal to the value of her output, which is
		\begin{equation*}
		y =  \Bigg\{\begin{array}{cc}
		p_{n,c} & \textnormal{ if } \sigma = n \\
		\tilde{z}(z,{Z}_{c})  & \textnormal{ if } \sigma = t \end{array}
		\end{equation*}
	\item Tradables production depends on own ability $(z)$, time spent producing ($\beta$), time spent exchanging ideas ($1-\beta$), and local learning opportunities $(Z_{c})$:
		\begin{equation*}
		\tilde{z}(z,Z_c) = \max_{\beta\in[0,1]} B(1-\beta,z,Z_c)
		\end{equation*}

\begin{itemize}
\item Scalar $Z_c$ depends on time-allocation decisions of all agents in $c$. 
\item Denote idea-exchange time of ability $z$ in city $c$ by $1-\beta_{z,c}$ 
\item Denote local ability distribution $\mu(z,c)$, where $\frac{\mu(z,c)}{\mu(z)}$ is the share of $z$ in $c$.
		\begin{equation*}
		Z_c = Z(\{1-\beta_{z,c}\},\{\mu(z,c)\}). \label{eqn:bigZfunction}
		\end{equation*}
\item Denote total time devoted to learning by tradables producers in city $c$ by $M_c$
\begin{equation*}
M_{c} = L \int_{z: \sigma(z)=t}(1-\beta_{z,c})\mu(z,c) dz.

\begin{frame}{Idea exchange: General assumptions}
\begin{itemize}
{\small
\item \textbf{Assumption 1}. 
The production function for tradables
$B(1-\beta,z,Z_c)$ is continuous,
strictly concave in $1-\beta$,
strictly increasing in $z$, and increasing in $Z_c$.
$B(1-\beta,z,0)=\beta z$ and $B(0,z,Z_c)=z$ $\forall z$.
\item \textbf{Assumption 2}. 
Tradables output $\tilde{z}(z,Z_c)$ is supermodular and
is strictly supermodular on $\otimes \equiv \{(z,Z): \tilde{z}(z,Z)>z\}$.
\item \textbf{Assumption 3}. 
The idea-exchange functional
$Z(\{1-\beta_{z,c}\},\{L\cdot\mu(z,c)\})$
is continuous, equal to zero if $M_c=0$, and bounded above by $\sup \{z:1-\beta_{z,c}>0,\mu(z,c)>0\}$.
If  $M_{c} > M_{c'}$ and $\{(1-\beta_{z,c})\mu(z,c)\}$ stochastically dominates $\{(1-\beta_{z,c'})\mu(z,c')\}$,
then $Z(\{1-\beta_{z,c}\},\{L\cdot\mu(z,c)\})>Z(\{1-\beta_{z,c'}\},\{L\cdot\mu(z,c')\})$.
}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
% -----------------------------------------
\begin{frame}{Idea exchange: Special case}
For some of our analysis, we focus on particular functional forms for $B(\cdot)$ and $Z(\cdot)$:
\begin{align*}
&B(1-\beta,z,Z_c) = {\beta}z(1+(1-\beta)A{Z}_{c}z) \\
&Z(\{(1-\beta_{z,c}),\mu(z,c)\})  = \left(1-\exp(-\nu M_c) \right) \bar{z}_{c} \\
\bar{z}_{c} & =\Bigg\{\begin{array}{cc}
\int_{z: \sigma(z)=t}\frac{(1-\beta_{z,c})z}{\int_{z: \sigma(z)=t}(1-\beta_{z,c})\mu(z,c) dz}\mu(z,c) dz & \textnormal{ if }M_{c}>0\\
0 & \textnormal{ otherwise } \nonumber
\end{array} 
\end{align*}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Random matching: Probability of encounter during each moment of time spent seeking idea exchanges is $\left(1-\exp(-\nu M_c) \right)$
	\item $M_{c}$ is the total time devoted to idea exchange
	\item $\bar{z}_{c}$ is the average ability of the individuals encountered

\begin{frame}{Two lemmas}
\begin{lemma}[Comparative advantage]
\label{lemma:ComparativeAdvantage}
Suppose that Assumption 1 holds. There is an ability level $z_m$ such that individuals of greater ability produce tradables and individuals of lesser ability produce non-tradables. 
\begin{align*}
\sigma(z) =  \Bigg\{\begin{array}{cc}
t & \textnormal{ if } z > z_m \\
n & \textnormal{ if } z < z_m \end{array}
\end{align*}
\end{lemma} 
\begin{lemma}[Spatial sorting of tradables producers engaged in idea exchange]\label{lemma:spatialsorting}
Suppose that Assumption 2 holds. For $z>z'>z_m$, if $\mu(z,c)>0$, $\mu(z',c')>0$, $\beta(z,Z_{c})<1$, and $\beta(z',Z_{c'})<1$, then $Z_c \geq Z_{c'}$.
\end{lemma}
\end{frame}
% -----------------------------------------
\begin{frame}{Spatial equilibrium}
\begin{proposition}[Heterogeneous cities' characteristics] \label{prop:crosscitycharacteristics}
Suppose that Assumptions 1 and 2 hold. In any equilibrium, a larger city has higher housing prices, higher non-tradables prices, a better idea-exchange environment, and higher-ability tradables producers. If $L_c > L_{c'}$ in equilibrium, then $p_{h,c}>p_{h,c'}$, $p_{n,c}>p_{n,c'}$, $Z_c>Z_{c'}$, and $z>z'>z_m \Rightarrow$ $\mu(z,c)\mu(z',c')\geq\mu(z,c')\mu(z',c)=0$.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Helpful to define a production-function property: 
	\begin{condition}\label{condition:outputelasticity}
	The ability elasticity of tradable output,
	$\frac{\partial\ln\tilde{z}\left(z,Z_{c}\right)}{\partial\ln z}$,

In an equilibrium in which the smallest city has population $L_{1}$ and the second-smallest city has population $L_{2}>L_{1}$,
\begin{enumerate}
\item if the ability distribution is decreasing, $\mu'(z)\leq0$, $\tilde{z}(z,Z_{c})$ is log-convex in $z$, and $\tilde{z}(z,Z_{c})$ is log-supermodular, then $\frac{\bar{w}_{2}}{p_{n,2}}>\frac{\bar{w}_{1}}{p_{n,1}}$;

\item if the ability distribution is uniform, $z\sim U\left(z_{\min},z_{\max}\right)$, the production function satisfies Condition \ref{condition:outputelasticity}, and $\frac{L_2 - L_1}{L_1^2} > \frac{1}{L}\frac{(1-\bar{n})(z_{\max} - z_{\min})}{z_{\min} +\bar{n}(z_{\max} - z_{\min})}$, then $\frac{\bar{w}_{2}}{p_{n,2}}>\frac{\bar{w}_{1}}{p_{n,1}}$.

\begin{frame}{Summary}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Spatial distributions of skills and sectors are prominent in public discussion of cities, exploited for variation in empirical work, and potentially key to understanding agglomeration processes
	\item Agglomeration has skill-biased productivity benefits:
	larger cities have higher relative quantities and relative wages for skilled
	\item We need models with more than two skills groups and more than perfectly specialized/diversified cities to understand empirical patterns
	\item Agglomeration has become more skill-biased since 1980; business services seem important driver of recent decades
	\item Dynamics: Still much to investigate in the story of Lucas (1988, \S 6)

	\item ``A host of papers make use of such instruments for identification''
	\item {\small ``The main source of identifying variation in Bartik instruments comes from differing base year industry compositions across local labor markets.

The claim for instrument validity in shift-share instrumental variable (SSIV) regressions must rely on some assumptions about the shocks, exposure shares, or both.\par

GPSS say shares are exogenous.
\begin{quote}{\small
Once we think about the shares as the instruments, the implied empirical strategy is an exposure research design, where the industry shares measure the differential exogenous exposure to the common shock

AKM and BJH say shocks are exogenous.
BJH on ADH example:
\begin{quote}{\small
exogeneity of industry employment shares is difficult to justify a priori since unobserved industry shocks (e.g., automation or innovation trends) are likely to affect regional outcomes through the same mixture of exposure shares. Our approach, in contrast, allows researchers to specify a set of shocks that are plausibly uncorrelated with such unobserved factors.\par

How do you build housing for poor people? You build housing for rich people in the past.
\href{https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.104.2.687}{Rosenthal (\textit{AER} 2014)}:
\begin{quote}{
	While filtering has long been considered the primary mechanism by which markets supply low-income housing, direct estimates of that process have been absent.
	This has contributed to doubts about the viability of markets and to misplaced policy.
	I fill this gap by estimating a ``repeat income'' model using 1985-2011 panel data.
	Real annual filtering rates are faster for rental housing (2.5 percent) than owner-occupied (0.5 percent), vary inversely with the income elasticity of demand and house price inflation, and are sensitive to tenure transitions as homes age.
	For most locations, filtering is robust which lends support for housing voucher programs.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Write a spatial-equilibrium model with two skill types and elasticities to be estimated
	\item ``In the first step, a maximum likelihood estimator is used to identify how desirable each city is to each type of worker, on average, in each decade, controlling for workers' preferences to live close to their state of birth.''
	\item ``The second step of estimation uses a simultaneous equation nonlinear generalized method of moments (GMM) estimator. Moment restrictions on workers' preferences are combined with moments identifying cities' labor demand, housing supply, and amenity supply curves.''
	\item Housing supply elasticities are identified by the response of housing rents to the Bartik shocks across cities. 
	\item The interactions of the Bartik productivity shocks with cities' housing markets identify the labor demand elasticities.
