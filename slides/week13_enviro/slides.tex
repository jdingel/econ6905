\begin{frame}{Today: Spatial environmental economics}
We've already seen environmental features play various roles in this course.
For example, 
first-nature ``locational fundamentals'' are often environmental features:
deep-water harbors lower trade costs,
and
waterfront views are amenities that anchor neighborhood sorting by income.
\vspace{1cm}
Three themes for today's whirlwind tour of spatial environmental economics
\begin{itemize}
	\item Valuing environmental amenities
	\item Environmental policy and comparative advantage
	\item Spatial margins of adjustment 
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
% -----------------------------------------
\begin{frame}{Hedonic pricing of air pollution}
\begin{itemize}
\item Classic application of spatial equilibrium: value environmental amenities
\item Does the US government regulate air too much/little? Cost-benefit analysis requires estimates of each, and there isn't a (direct) market for clean air
\item \href{https://doi.org/10.1086/427462}{Chay and Greenstone (2005)} study the capitalization of total suspended particulates (TSPs) air pollution into housing values
\item Price of house $i$ depends on its characteristics, $P_i = P(Z)$. What's $\frac{\partial P_i(Z)}{\partial z_n}$?
\item If some elements of $Z$ are unobserved and covary with $z_n = \text{TSPs}$, difficult to estimate the hedonic price schedule
\item E.g., areas with higher levels of TSPs tend to be more urbanized and have higher per capita incomes, population densities, and crime rates
\item \href{https://doi.org/10.1086/261981}{Smith and Huang (1995)}: 1/4 of estimates have perverse \textit{positive} correlation between housing prices and pollution levels
\item I'll focus on the OVB problem; see article for heterogeneous WTP
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
% -----------------------------------------
\begin{frame}{Clean Air Act regulation of TSPs}
\begin{itemize}
\item Clean Air Act Amendments of 1970 requires the Environmental Protection Agency to annually assign each county to either nonattainment or attainment status for each of five pollutants if above either:
\begin{itemize}
\item Threshold 1: the annual geometric mean concentration exceeds 75 $\mu$ g/m$^{3}$
\item Threshold 2: the second-highest daily concentration exceeds 260 $\mu$ g/m$^{3}$
\end{itemize}
\item In their nonattainment counties, states are required to develop plant-specific regulations for every major source of pollution
\item Local rules mandate investments in state-of-the-art pollution abatement equipment
\item Chay and Greenstone (2005) focus on TSPs because limited data for other regulated pollutants in early 1970s
\end{itemize}

{  Data cover 988 counties
First, in the absence of arbitrary assumptions about which counties constitute separate markets, it is necessary to assume that there is a national housing market.
the hedonic approach as originally conceived is an individual-level model, and aggregation to the county level may induce some biases
}
\end{frame}
% -----------------------------------------
\begin{frame}{Valuations}
\begin{itemize}
\item A welfare analysis of the non-marginal reductions in TSPs induced by the mid-decade TSPs regulations requires estimation of the MWTP \textit{function}
\item ``A popular, but likely invalid, assumption is that preferences are homogeneous and linear with respect to air quality, so that the MWTP for clean air is constant''
\item Mean housing values increased by roughly \$2,400 in nonattainment counties. With $\sim$19 million houses in these counties, the WTP is $\sim$\$45 billion.
\item Per Rosen-Roback model, cannot only look at housing prices: WTP for lower TSPs shows up in housing-price differences \textit{and} wage differences
\item 2SLS regression with log income as outcome yields precise zero

\href{https://doi.org/10.1086/713101}{Heblich, Trew, Zylberberg (2021)} on 70 largest metropolitan areas in England
\begin{itemize}
\item ``The heavy reliance on coal 1850--1960 generated unprecedented concentrations of sulphur dioxide in the atmosphere, which scarred cities''
\item ``Pollution from historical factories accounted for about 15\% of the variation in neighborhood composition in 1881.''
\item ``There is no evidence of excess deprivation in neighborhoods downwind from industrial chimneys before the rise of industrial coal in 1817.''
\item ``Industrial coal pollution effectively stopped in the 1970s, but the path dependence in neighborhood sorting is still felt today.''
\item ``The persistence of neighborhood sorting is tied not only to relocation frictions but also to its interaction with preferences for neighborhood composition.''

First-order approximation of productivity changes: $\Delta A_i = \sum_{k \in K} \sum_{f \in \mathcal{F}_i} \rho_i^{fk} \Delta A_i^{fk}$
\begin{itemize}
\item The approximation ignores terms of trade effects
\item
$\rho_i^{fk} \equiv p_i^k Q_i^{fk} / Y_i$  denotes the initial $fk$ share of country $i$'s GDP
\item
$\rho_i^{fk} = \rho_i^k \times \phi_i^{fk}$ with revenue $\rho_i^k \equiv p_i^k Q_i^k / Y_i $ and output $\phi_i^{fk} \equiv Q_i^{fk} / Q_i^k$ shares
\item Logit math yields
$\phi_i^{fk} = \frac{(A_i^{fk})^\theta[\alpha_i^\theta + \sum_{l\in K} (p_i^l A_i^{fl})^\theta]^{(1-\theta)/\theta}}{\sum_{g\in\mathcal{F}_i} (A_i^{gk})^\theta[\alpha_i^\theta + \sum_{l\in K} (p_i^l A_i^{gl})^\theta]^{(1-\theta)/\theta}},$
which can be computed using GAEZ productivity, price data, and estimated $\alpha_i$ and $\theta$
\item Indonesia, the median country, has $\Delta A_i = - 1.3\%$
\item For world, climate change is $-0.34\%$ decrease in GDP

\item Farmers' ability to substitute crops when comparative advantage shifts may substantially mitigate the ill effects of climate change.

No trade adjustment: fix crop export shares at baseline
\begin{itemize}
\item Require exports of crop $k$ by country $i$ to stay constant fraction of output
$$\sum_{j\neq i} \tau_{ij}^k (C_{ij}^k)^{'} / (Q_i^k)^{'} = \sum_{j\neq i} \tau_{ij}^k C_{ij}^k/ Q_i^k  \ \forall ik$$
\item Impose quantity restrictions by equivalent wedges $\delta_i^k$ (trade taxes)
$$(p_{ij}^k)^{'} = \delta_i^k \tau_{ij}^k (p_i^k)^{'} \ \forall i \neq j \in \mathcal{I}, \forall k \in \mathcal{K}$$
\item World welfare loss of 0.27\% is virtually same as in case of full adjustment

\begin{frame}{Recall: Log-supermodularity}
\hypertarget{appendix:LSM}{}
A function $g:\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}^{+}$ is \emph{log-supermodular} if $\forall x,x'\in\mathbb{R}^n$
\begin{align*}
g\left(\max\left(x,x'\right)\right)\cdot g\left(\min\left(x,x'\right)\right)\geq g(x)\cdot g(x')
\end{align*}
where $\max$ and $\min$ are component-wise operators.
\begin{itemize}
%	\item Example: $A: \Sigma\times\mathbb{C}\to\mathbb{R}^{+}$, where $\Sigma\subseteq\mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{C}\subseteq\mathbb{R}$, with $\sigma>\sigma'$ and $c>c'$
%		\begin{align*}
%		A(\sigma,c)A(\sigma',c')\geq A(\sigma',c)A(\sigma,c')
%		\end{align*}
	\item $g(x)$ is LSM in $(x_i,x_j)$ if $g(x_i,x_j;x_{-i,-j})$ is LSM 
	\item $g(x)$ is LSM $\iff g(x)$ is LSM in $(x_i,x_j)$  $\forall i,j$
	\item $g>0$ and $g$ is $C^2$ $\Rightarrow \frac{\partial^2 \ln g}{\partial x_i \partial x_j}\geq 0 \iff g(x)$ is LSM in $(x_i,x_j)$
\end{itemize}
Some handy properties:
\begin{itemize}
	\item LSM is preserved by multiplication and integration
	\item An argmax of a LSM objective is increasing in other variables
